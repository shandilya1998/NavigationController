The never-ending mysteries of nature have always instilled in me curiosity and fervour to understand it. My inclination towards studying biological systems and a passion for problem-solving led me to join the Biomedical Design program at IIT Madras, where I had the chance of working on several Artificial Intelligence (AI) problems. Through my academic experiences, I realised that the robustness and generalisability of state of the art AI algorithms is no match for natural intelligence, although they exhibit beyond human capabilities at specific tasks. Moreover, the computational requirements of these algorithms restrict them to particular hardware. With the end of Moore's law and the limits to parallelism due to Amdahl's law, I believe the next breakthroughs in AI systems design will come from biology and engineering, specifically Computational Neuroscience and Biomimetic Design.
I think biomimetic AI systems have an advantage over conventional systems in that they require fewer resources yet have better generalisability and robustness of performance. I want to demonstrate and investigate this possible advantage through my research by implementing sensorimotor processing on biomimetic cyber-physical systems with neural control systems designed using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and models of functional and structural organisation of the brain. The CSE PhD program at the University of Washington (UW) is the ideal opportunity to pursue my research interests. Being in the presence of those investigating problems in a similar domain will bolster my research output through productive collaboration, ideation and knowledge exchange. The program will also help me build the interpersonal skills and research ideas necessary to pursue my long term entrepreneurial goals of using biomimetic robots for dangerous disaster sites to make search and rescue operations safer and more effective.
I think I am an excellent fit to be a part of the Neural Systems Lab and the Robot Learning Lab at UW. I believe I could contribute effectively to the ongoing research on models for perceptual decision making based on partially observable Markov decision processes at the Neural Systems Lab led by Professor Rajesh P.N. Rao and on task-agnostic generalisable reinforcement learning policies for whole body interaction with the environment for mobile robots at the Robot Learning Lab led by Professor Byron Boots.
If given an opportunity I would specifically like to investigate emergent behaviour and neural dynamics in artificial agents with biologically plausible DRL policies at the Neural Systems Lab. I want to find answers to questions like, “How can theories from Computational Neuroscience be leveraged to augment state-of-the-art DRL algorithms?” and “How to understand the basis for biological behaviour by simultaneous simulation of the hypothesised cause to emulate the behaviour on artificial agents?”. At the Robot Learning Lab, I would focus on learning policies for quadruped locomotion and manipulation. Quadruped robots, especially those without dedicated end-effectors must interact with their environments using their legs. I want to find answers to questions like “How to learn task-agnostic representations of the world to transfer manipulation and locomotion skills to unseen circumstances?” and “Can demonstrations from animal behaviour be used to augment learned generalisable skills for combined locomotion and manipulation?”. Furthermore, I am also interested in the work on control of complex movements in animals at the Movement Control Lab led by Professor Emo Todorov. I have been an avid user of the MuJuCo Physics Engine and could contribute to the work done by the lab on optimality of sensorimotor control.
I am currently employed by Professor VS Chakravarthy at the Computational Neuroscience (CNS) Lab, IIT Madras. I am developing a subsumption architecture for sensory perception and locomotion control of a quadruped robot. The objective is to create a general model for the functional organisation of brain-like sensorimotor processing systems and demonstrate continual learning. The project’s primary challenge has been implementing adaptive functioning in unknown environments, which in biological agents stems from their ability to explore the environment and then exploit the gained information to perform the task at hand. Taking inspiration from prior computational neuroscience research, I am working on integrating a reinforcement learning model of Basal Ganglia with deep neural networks (DNNs) to control a point agent's ability to autonomously explore any maze environment and find an assigned target using monocular vision. The end-to-end optimisation of such a model through DRL is hypothesised to demonstrate brain-like adaptive intelligence that learns with experience.
My final year capstone project, guided by Professor VS Chakravarthy and Professor T Asokan, involved co-designing a low-level behaviour controller (for joint angle trajectory generation) and the MePed Quadruped Platform. A novel Central Pattern Generator (CPG) architecture parameterised by a DNN was proposed. Using the novel CPG, synthetic data was generated for learning from "Self-Demonstrations”. The learned model can generate joint angle trajectories for crawling, trotting and galloping. Smooth gait transition, speed control, turning, and on-spot rotation were also demonstrated. Since all my work with Professor Chakravarthy results from an independent proposal of my entrepreneurial goals, all the hardware and software developed have evolved into an open-source repository of resources (link 1 & link 2) for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics research.
I have also worked at Siemens Technology & Services Private Limited, where I developed a Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning system for procedural activities. My contribution through this project was a differentiable K-Nearest Neighbour and Hidden Markov Model based loss for learning and evaluating a modality agnostic embedding space through Deep Learning (DL). I have also worked on mobile based AI applications such as a DL powered smart mobile scanner and an emotion-aware memory sharing application.
The flexible dual degree program at IIT Madras allowed me to take relevant graduate-level courses and training to complement my research activities. The courses on “Computational Neuroscience”, “Computational Models of Cognition”, and “Systems Engineering for Deep Learning” have had the most formative impact on my research interests. I could not only adapt to the rigorous research-intensive environment the courses created, but I learnt to thrive in it.
The challenges thrown at me by my academic journey have made me realise the importance of sustainable solutions backed by insightful research. The sheer joy and satisfaction that I experienced working on the aforementioned projects were instrumental in my decision to pursue research oriented entrepreneurship. Moreover, the complex and research intensive nature of my entrepreneurial goals require years of patient toiling. A PhD provides me with the necessary means and motivation to work towards my goals. My work has exposed me to the theoretical and practical specifics of Computational Neuroscience, DRL, DL and Robotics. My expertise also gives me the appropriate background to investigate and benchmark learning algorithms. Moreover, the insights that I have gained have only strengthened my belief that biomimetic AI systems have the potential to lead to groundbreaking breakthroughs in Robotics and AI. All of these experiences have prepared me for the challenges I may face in pursuing a PhD and I believe I am ready to take on independent research.
